# Welcome to Active Bend
We're a small but growing community of new to Bend, OR that are active across a variety of activities that wanted to better coordinate with each other. We're mountain bikers, climbers, skiiers, snowboards, runners, hikers, backpackers, paddleboard enthusiasts, float-the-river-with-beer fans, and sometimes just beer-around-town afficionados. We coordinate over slack (see below) to avoid overwhelming group texts.

## Slack
[slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/activebend/shared_invite/ enQtNjIxNzA1OTkxMDg5LTgyNzI1YTllZGZlYmQzMzU2MGI3NTJmM2ViNzFiZTNhZWNlNTlhZTdjYmYzNjJiZDdkYTg3Y2U5MDIxMGIwMGQ)
Slack channels are organized by activity - for example (but there are a lot more!):
 * #beers
 * #biking
 * #skiing-snowboarding
 * #hiking
 * #camping

## Calendar
Our attempt at a calendar of local events that interest us. Live music, beerfests, events on Mt. Bachelor, races, science / pub talks, and more. Bend has a _lot_ of events and we try to find the good stuff.

## Other Resources
We've attempted to map out a list of locals nights, happy hours, bars with music, and other helpful calendars around town: [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fo3NUsGfTnWXYeQs3zu8cBRFPahuH7Uck9FJnXFALlo/edit?usp=sharing)
